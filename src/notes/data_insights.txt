Column-by-Column Meaning:
Let’s carefully understand our exact dataset.

1. loan_id:
	-Identifier only
	-Dropping it
	-No predictive value

2. no_of_dependents:
	-Number of people financially dependent on applicant
	-More dependents -> higher expenses -> higher risk

3. education:
	-Graduate / Not Graduate
	-Proxy for income stability and earning potential

4. self_employed:
	-Yes / No
	-Self-employed income is less predictable -> higher risk

5. income_annum:
	-Annual income
	-Strong positive factor
	-Will require feature scaling to ensure balanced learning during optimization

6. loan_amount
	-Amount requested
	-Higher loan → higher EMI → higher risk

7. loan_term
	-Loan tenure (months or years)
	-Longer term → lower EMI but more interest risk

8. cibil_score(MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE)
	-Direct creditworthiness signal
	-Main Segregation factor

9. Asset Values (VERY POWERFUL)
	-residential_assets_value
	-House / flat value
	-commercial_assets_value
	-Shops, offices

10.luxury_assets_value
	-Cars, luxury goods

11.bank_asset_value
	-Savings, fixed deposits



-->> These asset-related features act as compensating risk factors, explaining approvals even for applicants with lower CIBIL scores.


12. loan_status (TARGET )
	-Approved / Rejected
	-This is what our model learns




Key Observations:

1. Loan approval is strongly correlated with CIBIL score.
2. Applicants with CIBIL > ~550 are mostly approved.
3. Exceptions exist where applicants with lower CIBIL are approved due to:
   - High income
   - High asset values
   - Stable employment
4. This suggests a multi-factor decision-making process rather than a hard threshold.



Expected importance of Features-
1. CIBIL score
2. Income
3. Total assets
4. Loan amount
5. Employment type
6. Dependents
7. Education


We will let the model learn the high importance of CIBIL Score Naturally, without hardcoding thresholds .
Our model will learn:

High cibil_score → strong positive weight

High assets → moderate positive weight

High loan_amount → negative weight

Many dependents → negative weight

The probability curve shifts based on combinations.
