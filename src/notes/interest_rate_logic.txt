INTEREST RATE LOGIC (CORE DESIGN)

1. Where Interest Rate Fits in the Pipeline

-> Interest rate is NOT learned by ML
-> It is a controlled business decision based on risk


2. Why We Don’t Predict Interest Rate Directly with ML?

Predicting interest rates directly using ML can be unsafe, opaque, and difficult to audit.
Instead, ML is used only to estimate borrower risk, while pricing decisions are handled using transparent rule-based logic.


3. Defining Risk Score:

From logistic regression we get:

Approval Probability (P) ∈ [0,1]


Definition:

Risk Score = 1 − P


Interpretation:

Risk Score ≈ 0 → very safe borrower

Risk Score ≈ 1 → very risky borrower


4. Risk Buckets :

Banks avoid fully continuous pricing due to stability and regulatory concerns.They price in risk buckets.

 Risk Bucket: 
Risk Score Range		Risk 	Category				Meaning
0.00 – 0.15	    Very Low Risk  	Excellent borrower
0.15 – 0.30	      Low Risk	          Safe borrower
0.30 – 0.45	     Medium Risk	         Acceptable risk
0.45 – 0.60	      High Risk	         Risky borrower
> 0.60	            Very High Risk	Reject / special handling

Risk buckets convert a continuous ML output into stable, auditable business decisions.



5. Interest Rate Mapping (Clear & Defensible)

Now map risk buckets → interest rates.

Mapping
Risk Category	Interest Rate

Very Low Risk	8.0%
Low Risk		9.5%
Medium Risk	11.5%
High Risk	14.5%
Very High Risk	Default action is rejection; extremely high interest rates are shown only for simulation or fallback analysis.


Why this makes sense?

-Higher risk → higher expected default → higher compensation
-Lower risk → customer-friendly pricing

Prevents unfair jumps due to tiny probability changes.This also protects customers from volatile pricing caused by small model fluctuations.

This approach ensures fairness, pricing stability, and regulatory explainability.


6. Guardrails (IMPORTANT)

Adding hard safety rules, regardless of ML output :

Maximum interest rate cap - 16.0%

Minimum interest rate floor - 8.0%

Automatic rejection above extreme risk
