EMI OPTIMIZATION LOGIC & AFFORDABILITY CONSTRAINTS

1. Purpose of EMI Optimization

After determining the applicant’s risk category and interest rate, the next objective is to recommend affordable and optimal EMI options that:

	-Minimize default risk for the bank
	-Keep repayment stress within acceptable limits for the customer
	-Provide multiple choices instead of a single rigid EMI

This step converts a pricing decision into a customer-facing financial plan.




2. EMI Calculation Overview

The system uses the standard banking EMI formula:

𝐸𝑀𝐼=(P.r.(1+r)^n)/((1+r)^n -1))
	​


Where:
P = Loan Amount
r = Monthly Interest Rate (annual rate / 12)
n = Loan tenure in months


This formula ensures:
	-Higher interest rates result in higher EMIs
	-Longer tenures reduce EMI but increase total interest paid





3. Affordability Constraint (Critical Business Rule)

Regardless of model output, the system enforces a hard affordability rule:

		Maximum EMI ≤ 40% of Monthly Income


Rationale:

-EMIs above this threshold significantly increase default probability

-This protects both the borrower and the lender


If no EMI option satisfies this constraint, the system will:

-Suggest reducing the loan amount

-Or recommend rejecting the loan





4. EMI Option Generation

Instead of recommending a single EMI, the system generates multiple EMI options across common tenures:

12 months

24 months

36 months

48 months

60 months


For each tenure:

-EMI is calculated using the approved interest rate

-Affordability constraint is checked

-Only valid EMI options are retained


This gives the borrower flexibility and transparency.




5. Ranking of EMI Options

Valid EMI options are ranked based on different optimization goals:

-Lowest EMI → best for monthly cash flow

-Lowest total interest paid → best long-term cost

-Balanced option → trade-off between EMI and interest

Example output:

Recommended EMI Options:
• ₹12,500 for 36 months (Best balance)
• ₹9,200 for 60 months (Lowest EMI)
• ₹18,000 for 24 months (Lowest total interest)






6. Integration with Risk & Interest Rate Logic


The EMI optimization module operates after interest rate assignment:


Approval Probability → Risk Score → Risk Bucket → Interest Rate → EMI Options


Key principle:

EMI optimization does not influence risk estimation; it only operates on approved and priced loans.

This separation ensures:

	Clean system design

	Explainability

	Regulatory safety






7. Business Impact

For the Bank

	-Reduced default probability

	-Risk-adjusted pricing consistency

	-Controlled exposure through affordability checks

For the Customer

	-Transparent repayment options

	-EMI within financial comfort zone

	-Clear understanding of trade-offs







8. Design Philosophy

-Machine Learning estimates risk, not repayment plans

-Financial rules ensure stability and safety

-EMI recommendations balance customer affordability and bank profitability

-This approach reflects real-world loan underwriting systems, not a toy ML implementation.
