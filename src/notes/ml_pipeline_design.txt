📌 ML Pipeline Design

Model Type - Logistic Regression (Binary Classification with Probabilistic Output)

🔹 Model Inputs (Expected Importance Order):

The primary numerical input features to the model, ordered by expected influence on loan approval probability, are:

Loan Amount
-Represents the total credit exposure for the bank. Higher loan amounts increase repayment burden and risk.

Annual Income
-Indicates repayment capacity. Higher income generally reduces default risk.

Number of Dependents
-Acts as a proxy for financial obligations. More dependents imply higher expenses and increased risk.

Employment Type (Self-Employed or Not)
-Represents income stability. Self-employed applicants typically carry higher income volatility.

This ordering reflects expected influence based on domain understanding; actual importance is learned by the model during training.





🔹 Engineered Features:

1️⃣ Total Asset Value

A composite feature representing the applicant’s financial backing:

Total Assets = 
    (High weight × Bank Assets) +(Medium weight × Residential + Commercial Assets) +(Low weight × Luxury Assets)


Rationale:

Bank assets (cash, deposits) are the most liquid and reliable

Residential and commercial assets provide collateral value

Luxury assets are least reliable in distress scenarios

This feature explains cases where applicants with lower credit scores still receive approval due to strong asset backing.


2️⃣ Loan-to-Income Ratio:


Loan-to-Income  Ratio=Loan Amount/Annual Income

Interpretation:

Higher ratio → higher repayment stress → higher risk

Lower ratio → better affordability → lower risk

This feature captures affordability more effectively than raw income or loan amount alone.


3️⃣Asset-to-Loan Coverage Ratio:
	-Measures collateral strength and downside protection.

Predicts How easily can the person pay back




🔹 Categorical Feature Encoding

The following categorical feature is encoded numerically for the model:

Self-Employed

0 → Salaried

1 → Self-employed

Encoding ensures compatibility with linear models while preserving interpretability.






🔹 Target Variable (Model Output)

Loan Status

1 → Loan Approved

0 → Loan Rejected

The model predicts the probability of approval, not a hard decision.






🔹 Feature Scaling

Since logistic regression relies on gradient-based optimization and the sigmoid function, numerical features must be scaled to ensure balanced learning.

Applied to:

-Income
-Loan amount
-Asset values
-Ratios

Scaling approaches:

Min-Max Scaling (0 to 1)
or Standardization (mean 0, standard deviation 1)

Scaling prevents large-magnitude features from dominating gradient updates.






🔹 Model Intuition

The model learns a weighted linear combination of input features:

𝑧=𝑤1𝑥1+𝑤2𝑥2+⋯+𝑤𝑛𝑥𝑛	​


This value is passed through a sigmoid function to produce an approval probability between 0 and 1, representing the applicant’s likelihood of loan approval.
